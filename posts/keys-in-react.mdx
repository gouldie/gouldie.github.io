# React - Keys

## Why using an index is sometimes not enough

### Keys - what actually are they?

When rendering a list, it is best practice to provide a key attribute to each list item to help
React uniquely identify it. This allows React to keep track of each list item and ensures that,
between each render, the internal state of each list item is preserved.

Fail to provide a key and React will give you a warning. Many code-analysis tools such as ESLint
will also show a warning. Without a key, React will default to using indexes.

Typically, a unique ID from your data set should be used. Developers will often use an index for
convenience as it is provided by the `map` function.

### Why using an index is sometimes not enough

So, you've provided the index as a key. Warnings have disappeared. What could go wrong?

Here is a simple stock management app. It displays a list of products and the number of stock
available for each one. It has two main features:

- The user can update the stock for a particular product
- The user can shuffle the order of the products

Product data is initialised in memory. In a more realistic scenario, this would come from a
database.

<PostImage src='/images/keys-2.png' alt='Initial product data' width='200px' />

Parent component iterates through the products, rendering a child component for each one. Each child
has its own local state for updating the stock number. Also note that each child is given the index
as its key.

If we were to shuffle the list, a product could end up in a different position and thus be given a
different key.

Keys no longer uniquely identify a product. React can no longer uniquely identify each product.
State becomes corrupt.

### So what's the solution?

Ensure each item has unique identifier. If it's a database resource, it may already have a unique id
you can use.

<PostImage src='/images/keys-5.png' alt='Giving each product a unique id' width='200px' />

Use the unique identifier as the key rather than the index.

<PostImage
  src='/images/keys-6.png'
  alt='Passing the unique id as a key into each list item'
  width='600px'
/>

Finally, React should now be able to track each list item correctly.

tl;dr - only use indexes as keys if you are sure the list order and length will not change. If in
doubt, use a unique identifier.
