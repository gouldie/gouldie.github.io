# Keys in React

## Why using an index is sometimes not enough

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
```

If you're familiar with React, you've probably come across this warning before. It occurs when
attempting to render a list using `map` without providing a key to each list item.

So, provide a key, and the warning disappears. Problem solved? Not always.

There can be some confusion around why the keys are required and what their values should be.

### Why are keys required?

It's about optimization.

Due to
React's&nbsp;<a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#the-diffing-algorithm' target='_blank'>
diffing algorithm</a>, it cannot efficiently determine when a list order changes, or when items are
added or removed.

Take this example of a list that you are asking React to render using the `map` function:

```js
<li>🍞 Bread. Stock: 5</li>
<li>🥚 Eggs. Stock: 3</li>
<li>🥛 Milk. Stock: 4</li>
```

Now, let's pretend the user deletes the first element, 🍞.

```js
<li>🥚 Eggs. Stock: 3</li>
<li>🥛 Milk. Stock: 4</li>
```

We know that 🍞 was simply deleted and the rest shifted up. But React does not. It cannot know
whether 🍞 was deleted, or whether 🥚 was deleted and 🍞 renamed to 🥚, or whether 🥛 was swapped
with 🍞, 🥛 renamed to 🥚 and 🥚 renamed to 🥛.

This might not seem like a big deal, but in a real application, each of these list items would
likely have some underlying state, and making the wrong assumption could lead to unintended
side-effects.

### Enter the key prop

The `key` prop allows the developer to give React a hint as to which list item is which.

Using the same example, but with a key:

```js
<li key="bread">🍞 Bread. Stock: 5</li>
<li key="eggs">🥚 Eggs. Stock: 3</li>
<li key="milk">🥛 Milk. Stock: 4</li>
```

Let's say the user deletes the 🥚 this time.

```js
<li key="bread">🍞 Bread. Stock: 5</li>
<li key="milk">🥛 Milk. Stock: 4</li>
```

React knows the second element was deleted, because the key is now gone. As a result React can
perform the re-render much more efficiently.

If you don't provide a key, React will take the index by default.

### Why using an index is sometimes not enough

Using a key as an index _will_ supress Reacts warning, however, it can produce unintended
side-effects if the list can change (re-order, add or remove elements).

Using the same example, with an index as a key:

```js
<li key={0}>🍞 Bread. Stock: 5</li>
<li key={1}>🥚 Eggs. Stock: 3</li>
<li key={2}>🥛 Milk. Stock: 4</li>
```

User deletes the second element, 🥚.

```js
<li key={0}>🍞 Bread. Stock: 5</li>
<li key={1}>🥚 Eggs. Stock: 3</li>
```

When 🥚 was deleted, 🥛 took over position 2 (index 1) in the array, and therefore key 1. In other
words, React thinks 🥛 was deleted because key 2 no longer exists.

This funky behaviour _can_ depend on your implementation, but generally it's best not to mess around
and simply provide React a key that meets the following criteria:

- It must be stable (not change during the lifetime of the component)
- It must be unique within the list

### Try it yourself

Here is a simple stock management app. It displays a list of products and the number of stock
available for each one. It has two main features:

- The user can update the stock for a particular product
- The user can shuffle the order of the products

Unfortunately, the developer used the product index as the key for each `<Product />`. As a result,
shuffling doesn't work as expected. Can you fix it?

<StockManagement />

Hint: you'll need to find (or create) a unique identifier for each product, and assign that as the
`<Product />` key.
